Device Summary:   
This lock-device was created as a senior design project for the University of California, Riverside. The lock-device was developed using C language in the Arduino IDE and uses two Arduino Uno units. The two Arduino Uno units are used as the transmitter (Tx) and Receiver (Rx) for the project. Attached to the Tx Arduino Uno is the IR LED and two buttons. Attached to the Rx Arduino Uno is a TFT display, stepper motor, keypad, and IR Receiver.

Notes:  
Included in this repository is all the necessary header files and main-file code needed to run the device for both the Tx and Rx components. The header files that are not included in this repository is already built into the Arduino IDE.
